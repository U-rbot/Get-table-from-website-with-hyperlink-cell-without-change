Excel Power Query:

Open Excel and go to the "Data" tab.

Click on "From Web" in the "Get & Transform Data" section.

In the "From Web" window, enter the URL of the webpage that contains the table you want to extract and click "OK".

The "Navigator" window will appear and display a list of tables available on the webpage. Select the table you want to extract and click "Edit".

The Power Query Editor window will appear, displaying the table data. To extract the hyperlink text, you will need to transform the column containing the text to include hyperlinks.

a. Click on the column header for the column containing the hyperlink text.
b. In the "Add Column" tab, click "Custom Column".
c. In the "Custom Column" window, enter a name for the new column and enter the following formula to create a hyperlink for the text:

less
Copy code
=IFERROR(HYPERLINK(INDEX(SPLIT([Column1],",",1),1),INDEX(SPLIT([Column1],",",2),1)),[Column1])
This formula splits the text by the comma character (assuming the text is in the format "text, URL"), creates a hyperlink for the URL, and returns the hyperlink text.

d. Click "OK" to create the new column.

Once you have transformed the column, you can save the table data to a CSV file by clicking "Close & Load" in the "Home" tab and selecting "Close & Load To" -> "CSV".
